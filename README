These are some commands that I created in order to more easily
manage my daily activity with my Django projects

Backup
------

Dump like the dumpdata command but use as default the --natural flag


Phoenix
-------

Simply do a sequence of commands that reset the database to an initial
stage loading a default admin account with credential 'admin' and 'password'.

I use this to recreate locally the situation of a deployied server so to not
have to remember the sequence of commands and options to issue.


Log Entry
---------

Dump the content of the admin.logentry model so to know what has been created
from the admin interface.
